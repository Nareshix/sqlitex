## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-15

### Perf
Reduce binary size by moving compile-time sqlite checks to macros

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-14

### Docs
updated docs on migration

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-14

### Features

- Improved robustness of type inference system.
- Auto generate parameter names from SQL context
- Added native migration support
- **[breaking]** Smarter Query Return Types. Compiler will mostly help you to fix the changes. More detailed explanation can be found in the release, below is just a brief exmaple.

  - **Unique/PK lookups** now return `Option<T>`:
    - _Old:_ `let user = db.get_user(1)?.first()?;`
    - _New:_ `let user = db.get_user(1)?;`
  - **Aggregate queries** (e.g. COUNT(*)) now return `T` directly:
    - _Old:_ `let stats = db.get_stats()?.first()?.unwrap();`
    - _New:_ `let stats = db.get_stats()?;`
  - **Single column queries** now return primitive types (e.g., `i64`, `String`) instead of structs:
    - _Old:_ `let count = db.count_users()?.first()?.unwrap().col_0;`
    - _New:_ `let count: i64 = db.count_users()?;`

### Bug fixes
- strings with null bytes will be captured and not cut off #68



## [0.3.1] - 05-05-2026

`pretty-assertion` crate is now a dev dependency, thus won't be included in final binary

## [0.3.0] - 05-05-2026

### Added

- added `execute_batch()` where we can run multiple chained sql statements (via `;`) at runtime.
- added `_bulk` methods for write statements to easily have bulk operation without resorting to transactions

- Generates an `init()` method if you are connecting via an external sql file. This allows us to easily run whatever is defined in that sql file.
- Generates a `open_connected_db()` method if you are connecting via an external sqlite database. This allows us to easily connect to the database after naming it at macro level.
- Nested transactions are now supported

### Fixed

- compile time checks for virtual tables are not supported. Added this specific error for better clarity.
- more robust error handling and suggestions for STRICT Table to get maximum benefits of this library. It will auto detect types that are valid but invalid in STRICT table and will suggest the correct type. It will also suggest using `CHECK (col in (0 or 1))` if you want to get `bool` type safety
- doc comments for most commonly used functions are written deatilly
- panic within transaction now rollback Database, preventing it from deadlock

- `CREATE TABLE` detection is now more robust by using AST parsing instead of string matching.

### Breaking Changes

- fn name changes
  1. `execute_runtime()` → `execute()`
  2. `query_runtime` → `query()`

### Internal

- unify type mapping and remove redundant code
- Removed `check_constraint` field in `ColumnInfo` struct as it is no longer being used
- removed `exec` fn and replaced all macro genreation which dependent on it with `execute_batch`

## [0.2.3 - 0.2.5] - 2026-05-04

Documentation testing

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-03

### Changed

The default PRAGMA settings when using the library are

```sql
PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
```

This gives best performance and high relibaility

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-02

Documentation formatting

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Type casting between different types are now more strict. This is to prevent unexpected and unintuitive behavior at runtime.

Only the following casts are allowed:

    - Integer -> Real
    - Real -> Integer (Truncates towards zero)
    - Integer -> Text
    - Real -> Text
    - Bool -> Integer (true -> 1, false -> 0)
    - Bool -> Real (true -> 1.0, false -> 0.0)

### Migration

In previous versions, type casting was flexible. Any type could be casted to any other type. Upgrading to 0.2.0 introduces stricter rules that may break existing code. However, the changes are straightforward as the compiler will flag every affected line, making the fixes straightforward to apply.

## [0.1.1 - 0.1.10] - 2026-05-02

Docuemntation updates and improvements. No code changes.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

1. casting as BOOL is now supported
2. able to create table with BOOL datatype
3. BLOB are now fully supported.
4. pg `::` syntax remains and doesnt get translated to CAST AS when hovering over the function name in VSCode.
5. better error messages

### Changed

Mostly variable and macro names have been changed for better clarity, but features are identical

1. Library name changed from `lazysql` →`sqlitex`
2. `LazyConnection `→ `Connection`
3. `sql_runtime!()` → `sql_escape_hatch!()`
4. `execute_dynamic()` → `execute_runtime()`
5. `query_dynamic()` → `query_runtime()`

## Earlier

Library was originally named LazySql. Other than the naming changes and additional features mentioned in `sqlitex` 0.1.0 release, features are the same.
